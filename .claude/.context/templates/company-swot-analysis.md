## Example: Exelixis SWOT

**Strengths**

Exelixis's core product franchise cabozantinib (Cometriq/Cabometyx) is a
market-leading tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; first- and second-line therapy in
the US and as a second-line therapy in other major markets), and is
available in major markets for three additional oncology indications:
hepatocellular carcinoma, medullary thyroid cancer and differentiated
thyroid cancer; 2022 annual sales of approximately USD 2 billion (around
30% increase year-on-year) with big pharm as commercial partners (Ipsen
and Takeda)

Product innovation; successful track record of developing new products
with a quickly advancing and expanding R&D pipeline; Exelixis's pipeline
encompasses a mix of small-molecules and biologicals against a range of
targets and tumor types, with plans to advance multiple additional
programs into preclinical development in 2023

Collaborations through in-licensing and drug discovery and development
partnerships with international industry leaders, including BMS, Ipsen,
Takeda, Genentech, Aurigene Oncology, Storm Therapeutics, Catalent, NBE
Therapeutics, GamaMabs WuXi, Adagene, BioInvent, and Ryvu Therapeutics;
pipeline collaboration programs and license options include XL-102
(in-licensed from Aurigene Oncology), CBX-12 (license option with
Cybrexa Therapeutics), ADU-1805 (license option with Sairopa), XL-114
(option exercised under Aurigene) and Invenra collaboration programs
(eg, XB-014)

Potential to maintain cabozantinib patent exclusivity through to 2030

Exelixis has ≥ 6 years with annual profitability, with a share
repurchase program of USD 550 million expected to be completed in 2023

**Weaknesses**

Limited label in medullary thyroid cancer and differentiated thyroid
cancer (cabozantinib franchise)

Limited clinical data available for Exelixis's next-generation oral TKI
zanzalintinib; only interim data from the STELLAR-001 phase I
dose-escalation trial in solid tumors are available, with phase III
trials (STELLAR-003 and STELLAR-004) ongoing in metastatic
microsatellite stable colorectal cancer and advanced non-clear cell RCC

Several phase III trials initiated following positive phase I data (skip
phase trials) have failed, such as the CONTACT-03 study evaluating
cabozantinib in patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic
RCC who experienced radiographic tumor progression during or after
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, which was initiated following
positive phase I data observed in the COSMIC-021 study

Composition of matter patent for cabozantinib is slated to expire in
2026

Contribution to company's revenues for the cabozantinib franchise
(advanced melanoma; out-licensed to Genentech) and esaxerenone
(hypertension; licensed to Daiichi Sankyo) is small

Expenses increased in the past three years: from USD 877.5 million in
2020 to 1,409.6 billion in 2022 (around +60.6% in two years); R&D
expenses increased from USD 547.9 in 2020 million to 891.8 million in
2022 (+62.8%)

**Opportunities**

Leverage the cabozantinib franchise to expand market share and grow
revenue; Opdivo + Cometriq is being positioned as a preferred option in
first-line RCC based on robust efficacy, with a National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guideline category 1 recommendation for
the combination in this setting, and the breadth of the cabozantinib
development program provides significant potential for label expansions,
including in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CONTACT-02
top-line results expected in 2023) and non-small-cell lung cancer, and
in additional lines of therapy and combination regimens

Next-generation oral TKI zanzalintinib, with improved pharmacokinetics
compared with cabozantinib and the potential to replicate the success of
the cabozantinib franchise in first-line RCC (ongoing phase III
Stellar-304 trial in combination with Opdivo); zanzalintinib is also
being assessed in the phase III Stellar-303 trial in colorectal cancer,
an indication that could be a big growth driver, as well as in
combination with immuno-oncology therapies in several cancer settings in
the phase I Stellar-002 trial

Expansion of earlier-stage development programs; beyond cabozantinib and
zanzalintinib, Exelixis's pipeline is progressing both small-molecules
and biologicals, including XB-002 (next-generation tissue-factor
antibody-drug conjugate), XL-102 (CDK7 inhibitor) and CBX-12
(second-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor) in a wide range of solid
tumors

Opportunities also in the execution of license option agreements,
including with Cybrexa Therapeutics, Sairopa, Aurigene, Ryvu
Therapeutics, Adagene for candidate oncology therapeutics and
technologies

**Threats**

Uncertainties associated with cabozantinib's market exclusivity; generic
versions of cabozantinib may enter in the US in 2026, and legal
proceedings against the ANDA filers MSN Pharmaceuticals, Teva and Cipla,
which filed ANDAs in the US for generic Cabometyx tablets, are ongoing

Increasingly competitive market, particularly from immunotherapies in
RCC; competition for the cabozantinib franchise in both approved and
potential indications includes combination regimens Keytruda + Inlyta,
Yervoy + Opdivo, Keytruda + Lenvima and Welireg + Lenvima

Competition also for zanzalintinib is anticipated to come from Stivarga,
as well as the combination regimens of Camptosar + either Erbitux or
Keytruda, Lenvima + Keytruda, MK-4280 (Keytruda + favezelimab FDC) and
Lonsurf + Avastin

Concerns highlighted by Farallon Capital (main shareholder 7.8%)
regarding Exelixis's board of directors, a lack of a coherent R&D
strategy and spending, and the skip phase (from phase I to phase III)
approach that the company has used, but which has resulted in several
failures (eg, the failure of the cabozantinib CONTACT-03 study in to
meet its primary endpoints, which was initiated following positive phase
I data observed in the COSMIC-021 study)
