{DRUG_NAME} SWOT ANALYSIS

{INDICATION}

## Strengths

### Clinical Efficacy
- Best-in-class or superior efficacy vs comparators
- Specific clinical trial data (trial ID, % improvements, statistical significance)
- Head-to-head comparison results
- Duration of effect/sustained efficacy data

### Dosing & Administration
- Dosing frequency (once-daily, once-weekly, etc.)
- Route of administration advantages
- Formulation benefits (single-dose pen, oral, etc.)

### Safety & Tolerability
- Similarity to endogenous compounds (immunogenicity profile)
- Use in special populations (renal/hepatic impairment)
- Established safety profile

### Regulatory & IP
- Regulatory designations (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, etc.)
- Patent coverage timeline (US/EU expiry dates)
- Geographic approvals

### Competitive Positioning
- Differentiation from competitors
- Label advantages (no stopping conditions, broader indications)
- Combination therapy potential

## Weaknesses

### Safety Concerns
- Boxed warnings
- Contraindications
- Drug interactions
- Adverse event profile (>5% incidence)

### Clinical Limitations
- Efficacy not established in certain populations
- Ongoing trial requirements for definitive data
- Post-marketing requirements

### Label Restrictions
- Use restrictions with concomitant medications
- Special population limitations (pediatric, elderly)
- Monitoring requirements

### Practical Limitations
- Gastric emptying effects on other medications
- Administration challenges

## Opportunities

### Market Size & Growth
- Disease prevalence (US/global)
- Growing prevalence rates
- Chronic disease requiring long-term management

### Competitive Advantages
- Best-in-class positioning
- Superior efficacy data vs competitors
- Convenient dosing vs alternatives

### Market Dynamics
- High demand indicators
- Prescription trends vs competitors
- Company strength in therapeutic category

### Pipeline Expansion
- Additional indications in development
- Combination therapy opportunities
- Broader population expansion (pediatric, adolescent)

### Unmet Need
- Failure of current standard of care
- Limitations of non-pharmacologic approaches

## Threats

### Safety Perceptions
- Serious adverse event concerns
- Class effects (e.g., pancreatitis, thyroid concerns)
- Long half-life implications

### Treatment Paradigm
- Preference for lifestyle modification over pharmacotherapy
- Growing use of invasive procedures/devices
- Alternative medication strategies

### Market Access
- Reimbursement challenges
- "Lifestyle medication" perception
- Long-term safety concerns affecting payer coverage

### Competition - Existing
- First-mover competitors with established market share
- Generic/OTC alternatives
- Alternative mechanisms of action

### Competition - Pipeline
- Company's own pipeline cannibalization risk
- Competitor pipeline with superior profiles
- Novel mechanisms in development

### Supply & Manufacturing
- GMP issues
- Supply chain constraints
- Ability to meet demand

## Data Sources

Each claim should reference:
- Clinical trial IDs (NCT numbers)
- Publication references (PubMed IDs)
- FDA label sections
- Patent numbers
- Market research data

## Analysis Guidelines

### Strengths
Focus on:
- Quantified clinical benefits
- Head-to-head superiority data
- Unique advantages vs standard of care
- Regulatory/IP moats

### Weaknesses
Focus on:
- Label warnings and restrictions
- Clinical trial gaps
- Safety signals
- Practical use limitations

### Opportunities
Focus on:
- Market size and growth
- Unmet medical need
- Competitive positioning
- Pipeline potential
- Commercial traction

### Threats
Focus on:
- Safety perception risks
- Treatment paradigm shifts
- Competitive landscape (current + future)
- Market access barriers
- Supply/manufacturing risks

## Output Format

- Each point should be a single, clear statement
- Include specific data points (%, trial IDs, dates)
- Reference clinical trials, publications, and regulatory documents with PubMed IDs or NCT numbers
- Balance objective analysis without promotional framing
- Maintain therapeutic area context
- Note data currency and last update date

## Key Principles

1. **Evidence-based**: Every claim backed by clinical trial, regulatory, or market data
2. **Balanced**: Present both positive and negative aspects objectively
3. **Specific**: Use concrete data points, not vague statements
4. **Referenced**: Include trial IDs, publication IDs, patent numbers
5. **Current**: Note last update date and reflect latest available data
6. **Contextual**: Position within competitive landscape and treatment paradigm
7. **Actionable**: Insights should inform strategic decision-making

## Data Collection Requirements
