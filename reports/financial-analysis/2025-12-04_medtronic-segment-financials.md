| **GRAND TOTAL** | **$8.93B** | **+6.6%** | - | **100.0%** |

**Important Note on Coverage**: The 8.8% variance ($0.76B) is the **Diabetes segment**, which does not report subsegments in XBRL. This is a **reporting structure limitation**, not a data quality issue. The 8 divisions shown above cover only Cardiovascular, Neuroscience, and Medical Surgical segments. For complete revenue analysis including Diabetes, the main segment view must be used.

## Key Takeaways

### Growth Drivers
1. ✅ **Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure** leading with exceptional +15.6% YoY growth
2. ✅ (**) **Structural Heart (TAVR)** benefiting from valve market expansion (+8.5% YoY)
3. ✅ **Neuromodulation** maintaining high single-digit growth despite smaller base (+8.1% YoY)
4. ✅ **International expansion** significantly outpacing domestic (+8.4% vs +4.9%)

### Areas of Concern
1. ⚠️ **Surgical Endoscopy** (largest division) showing weak +1.8% YoY growth - (**) competitive pressure evident
2. ⚠️ **Specialty Therapies** near-flat at +0.9% YoY - (**) potential portfolio rationalization candidate
3. ⚠️ **Coronary Vascular** decelerating from +6.0% to +1.9% YoY - (**) mature stent market challenges
4. ⚠️ **US market** underperforming international - (**) pricing pressure and competitive dynamics

### Strategic Implications

**(**) Portfolio Mix Shift**:
- Cardiovascular (particularly Cardiac Rhythm) gaining share of total revenue
- Medical Surgical (particularly Surgical Endoscopy) losing momentum
- (**) Consider strategic investments or M&A to accelerate slower divisions

**(**) Geographic Focus**:
- International markets represent 49.6% of revenue with 71% faster growth
- (**) Emerging markets likely driving international outperformance
- (**) US market requires new product launches to reaccelerate

**(**) Innovation Pipeline Priority**:
- (**) Cardiac Rhythm leadership suggests recent launches (e.g., Micra AV, Aurora EV-ICD) driving share gains
- (**) Structural Heart growth consistent with TAVR market expansion (Evolut platform)
- (**) Surgical robotics investment critical to reverse Surgical Endoscopy deceleration

**(**) Market Share Dynamics**:
- (**) Cardiac Rhythm outperformance vs market (estimated 8-10% market growth) indicates share gains from Abbott, Boston Scientific
- (**) Surgical Endoscopy underperformance suggests share loss to Intuitive Surgical (robotics), Ethicon, J&J

## Fiscal Year Calendar Context

**Important Note**: Medtronic's fiscal year ends **April 30**, not December 31.

| Fiscal Quarter | Calendar Period | Example Date |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| FY2026 Q1 | May-Jul 2025 | Jul 25, 2025 |
| **FY2026 Q2** | **Aug-Oct 2025** | **Oct 24, 2025** (Latest) |
| FY2026 Q3 | Nov 2025-Jan 2026 | Jan 23, 2026 |
| FY2026 Q4 | Feb-Apr 2026 | Apr 30, 2026 |

**FY2026** = Fiscal year ending April 30, 2026
**FY2026 Q2** = The quarter ending October 2025 (2nd quarter of fiscal 2026)

## Data Quality & Methodology

### Data Source
- **Primary**: SEC EDGAR XBRL dimensional analysis (SubsegmentsAxis)
- **Filing Types**: 10-Q (quarterly), 10-K (annual)
- **XBRL Facts Processed**: 2,301 dimensional facts across 13 filings
- **Reconciliation**: Division total ($8.17B) + Diabetes segment ($0.76B) = $8.93B consolidated ✓

### Methodology
- **Division Revenue**: Extracted via XBRL SubsegmentsAxis (more granular than BusinessSegmentsAxis)
- **Fiscal Quarter Labeling**: Automated based on company's fiscal year end (April 30)
- **YoY Growth**: Comparison to same fiscal quarter prior year (4 quarters back)
- **QoQ Growth**: Sequential quarter comparison (FY2026 Q2 vs FY2025 Q3 when available)

### Why Division-Level Data?
This report uses **SubsegmentsAxis** from XBRL instead of the top-level **BusinessSegmentsAxis** to provide more granular insight:
- **8 divisions** covering 3 of 4 main segments (Cardiovascular, Neuroscience, Medical Surgical)
- **Product-line level visibility** (e.g., separating Cardiac Rhythm from Coronary Vascular within Cardiovascular)
- **Better understanding of portfolio mix** and growth drivers
- **Diabetes segment** reported separately (no subsegments in XBRL)

### Coverage & Limitations
- ✅ **8 divisions analyzed**: $8.17B (91.2% of total revenue)
- ⚠️ **Diabetes not subdivided**: $0.76B (8.8% of total) - analyzed at segment level only
- ✅ **Complete reconciliation**: Divisions + Diabetes = $8.93B consolidated revenue

### Verification
- ✅ **Source**: SEC EDGAR (official regulatory filings)
- ✅ **Completeness**: 100% revenue coverage (divisions + Diabetes segment = consolidated total)
- ✅ **Timeliness**: Latest available quarter (filed Nov 25, 2025)
- ✅ **Consistency**: XBRL structured data with dimensional validation
